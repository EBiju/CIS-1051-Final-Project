# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I planning on making a simple side scrolling game, similar to mario or megaman.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I need to first decide what to code the game in,
how much will I have to be accountable for when writing the game's code,
and what ideas I can use to create it.
